# Spec series — build order and status ledger

Every implementation session picks **one milestone of one spec**, in build
order, and follows `000-development-process.md`. This file is the single
status ledger: when a milestone lands green, update its row here in the same
PR.

A spec is implementable when every spec it builds on is **Implemented** (or
the specific milestones it needs are done). "Builds on" below mirrors each
spec's own header, which is authoritative.

| 017 | [testing-and-release](017-testing-and-release.md) | 000–016 | all | Spec ready |

Status values: `Spec ready` → `In progress (M<n> done)` → `Implemented`.
`Implemented` means the spec's own milestones and module-owned checks are green;
it does not claim that downstream components or end-to-end product paths exist.

## Deferred cross-spec obligations

These obligations are visible exceptions, not silent green coverage:

- SPEC-001's boundary-registry and gateway-purity guards remain dormant until
  server listener and gateway packages exist. Their skips are surfaced by the
  verification gate and their violation fixtures remain active.
- SPEC-003 G-5 currently proves the contract domain registry, round trips, and
  pairwise isolation. Its cross-repository sign-site + fail-closed verify-site
  floor activates when SPEC-005/007/013 add those consumers.

## Rules

- Specs are operator-approved. A material deviation needs operator sign-off
  before code; mechanical gaps are fixed in the spec in the same PR.
- Specs reference each other as `(REQ-ID, SPEC-NNN)`. Nothing in this repo
  references any external repository, issue tracker, or document.
- Every spec has: numbered requirements, acceptance criteria, a rejection-path
  table, a TDD test plan, and self-discovering guards. If you find one
  without, that is a spec bug — fix it before implementing.
